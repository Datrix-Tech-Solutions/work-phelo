    .setDescription(
      `
Broker-only Reinsurance Operations endpoints owned by \`reinsurance-service\`.

### Routes
- Through the API Gateway: \`/api/v1/operations/reinsurance/*\`
- Direct local service access: \`/api/*\`

### Authentication
Protected requests use the HTTP-only \`access_token\` cookie set by Auth login.
Bearer authentication is also documented for API tooling. Through the gateway,
tenant context and signed dynamic permissions are forwarded to this service.

### Authorization
Counterparty, placement and email endpoints require the tenant to have the \`operations\` module and
\`operations.reinsurance\` feature enabled, plus the endpoint-specific
\`operations.reinsurance.counterparties:*\`, \`operations.reinsurance.settings:*\` or
\`operations.reinsurance.placements:*\`, \`operations.reinsurance.email:*\` or
\`operations.reinsurance.email-settings:*\` permission.

### Risk settings integration
New frontend work should use \`/settings/risk-classes\` for RiskClass CRUD and
\`/settings/risk-types\` for RiskType CRUD, fields and form schemas.

### Slip previews
Offer and closing slip preview endpoints are read-only. They return preview
payloads only and do not create PDFs, persist document records or send email.
Preview calculations intentionally use \`facultativeOffer ?? 0\` when the
facultative offer is not yet known.

### Documents
Document endpoints create registry rows with immutable source snapshots and
renderer-ready payloads for future generated Reinsurance documents. PR1 does
not render PDFs, upload to S3, create download URLs or send emails. Future file
storage will use private S3 object storage with signed download URLs.

### Placement closings
Placement closing endpoints persist participant-specific closing snapshots for
accepted participants. Closings use the lifecycle \`DRAFT → ISSUED → CONFIRMED\`,
with \`VOID\` available from \`DRAFT\` or \`ISSUED\`. They do not create PDFs,
document registry entries, emails, payments, debit notes or credit notes.

### Debit and credit notes
Debit and credit note endpoints persist financial note records generated from
confirmed closing snapshots. Debit notes are placement-level cedant notes.
Credit notes are per confirmed reinsurer closing. NIC levy and withholding tax
are fixed at 0 in the MVP. Note generation, issuing and voiding do not
financially lock a placement; payments remain the only hard-lock trigger.

### Claims
Claim endpoints record loss events first. They capture occurrence details,
estimated loss and optional final loss amounts. Claim allocations are generated
explicitly from immutable CONFIRMED placement and endorsement closing snapshots
to calculate reinsurer liability. Claim cash calls are generated one per
allocation from those allocation snapshots. Claim notes, settlement payments,
documents, email workflows and accounting records remain deferred.

Financial lock status is available on placement detail responses and
\`GET /placements/:id/lock-status\`. Lifecycle edit rules and financial locks
are distinct: \`CLOSED\` placements block direct edits but may reopen to
\`CLOSING\` when no financial lock exists. The first recorded placement payment
hard-locks future direct mutations and requires the future endorsement workflow.
Reversal records do not unlock placements. Debit note issuance alone is not a
hard lock in the MVP policy.

### Endorsements
Endorsement endpoints create versioned placement adjustment records. The backend
captures \`originalSnapshot\` at creation and stores proposed changes separately.
Endorsements may be created once at least one placement closing exists. Before
	payment they are optional formal version records; after first payment they are
	the mandatory path for business changes because direct edits are financially
	locked. Endorsements do not mutate the original placement, participants,
	closings, payments or notes. Endorsement participants and endorsement closings
	are endorsement-scoped records for market responses and accepted endorsement
	business.

### Email foundation
The email endpoints are a technical foundation for embedded mailbox workflows:
connection metadata, provider verification, sync proof-of-concept, thread/message
metadata, manual placement links, placement-scoped conversation reads and
placement-scoped outbound send/reply persistence. They do not forward email,
send/download attachments, email generated documents, parse content with AI or
automatically update placements.

Documentation is exposed only when \`ENABLE_SWAGGER=true\`; the deployment
pipeline enables it for development only.
